website framework

Nick,
Basically I copied the church website, deleted all the content and created the pages I think we need for the choir.
So everything is up for grabs apart from the page names - but even those are not really fixed.
I added a few lines of text or a picture just to give an idea of the page purpose. Hopefully I will get some photos of the actual choir
to replace the clipart and Gospel Choir ones I used as place holders.
Enjoy yourself.
